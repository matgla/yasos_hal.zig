# Yasos HAL (Yet Another Simple Operating System - Hardware Abstraction Layer) (**WIP**)

> [!CAUTION]
> **_work in progress_** - API is unstable and a whole galaxy of bugs inside

This repository contains a hardware abstraction layer intended to be used by Yasos.zig. 
But it should be usable as a separate project too.

> [!NOTE]
> TODO

Right now you can follow usage inside [Yasos.zig](https://github.com/matgla/yasos.zig).
